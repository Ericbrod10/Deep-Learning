1. Test your program on breast cancer and ionosphere given on the website. Is the mini-batch faster or the original one? How about accuracy?

Batch-size has a high impact on the performance of mini-batch gradient descent, which can make it run slower or faster dependent on the size.
Accuracy suffers relative to normal SGD since it may not be as stable. For the two particular datasets on the website, 
mini-batch gradient descent gave a better accuracy on breast cancer predictions if the data was standardized than ionosphere, but the normal non-standardized ionosphere 
data was more stable than non-standardized breast cancer  



2. Is the search faster or more accurate if you keep track of the best objective in the inner loop?

The predictions would be more accurate and faster if we kept track of the best objective in the inner loop so we could cut it short if the objective started to get worse. 
As of right now the program could biased to a particular class and that could give us a wrong prediction.
