# CS 677 - Summer 2020

## Course Breakdown
This course will cover deep learning and current topics in data science. We will begin with machine learning background and then move to CUDA and OpenCL languages for parallel programming on Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) followed by OpenMP for multi-core programming. We will then proceed to neural networks, machine learning for image recognition, convolutional filters for image recognition, convolutional neural networks, optimization algorithms to train such networks, adversarial attacks, and deep learning for text.


### Grading Criteria
 - 40% Programming assignments
 - 25% Mid-term 
 - 35% Final exam
